This small project was made as part of CS50's weekly problem set 1, details of which can be found at https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/
The programme uses Luhn's algorithm (outlined below) to check the validity of given card numbers, and assign each card "visa", "mastercard", "amex" or "invalid".
Although not comprehensive, the check works on the majority of cards - ignoring some potential starting number of mastercard card numbers.

Luhn's algorithm:
1. With the card number, start from the penultimate digit. Moving left, double the value of every second digit.
2. Sum the digits of the resulting value in each position.
3. Add the sum of the resulting values from all positions.
4. If the last digit of the final sum is zero, the card is valid.
